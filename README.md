# Cochlear-Implant-Project
MATLAB code for Cochlear Implant Project that aims to explore the nuances of speech-to-speech, melody-to-melody signal processing. Original code written by myself include the code written to replicate Shannon et al's study (cochlear_replicate_study_lowpass, cochlear_replicate_study_hilbert), and the make_band_chimeras_modified code which introduces conflicting information between speech-to-speech/melody-to-melody envelope and fine structures to synthesize chimera sounds. Further information regarding Chimera signals can be found below. The main purpose of the chimera code is to conduct a simpler version of Smith et al's study regarding envelope and fine structure information within cochlear implant signal processing.
